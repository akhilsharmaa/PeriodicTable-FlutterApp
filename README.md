The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of elements, is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. The elements from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) have all been discovered or synthesized, which are given in this app.
We know that Chemistry is the study of different substances or element, and this app provides you all the knowledge about different elements that we have to know in this modern world. This app’s User Interfece(U.I.) and User Experience (U.I.) is the best and simple. You will learn a lot from this app no matter you are a student, a teacher, an engineer, a chemist, a housewife or a person of other provisions which have interest in chemistry.

When you will look at this app regularly, then your mind will be trained to remember all the elements in the periodic table and you will also remember all the details of the element which are given in this app.

All substances are composed of atoms, which are capable of forming molecules due to their chemical bonds. Chemistry mainly deals with these interactions at the atomic-molecular level, that is, at the level of chemical elements and their compounds.
